# Onja Javascript Project 1 : Imagine a quote generator

Have you just discovered JavaScript? Great ! But you will only become a JavaScript developer, and therefore a frontend developer, if you practice using concrete projects.

This first project was specially designed for those who are new to JavaScript programming and who are not used to developing algorithms. Your goal will be both simple and fun: you will build a quote generator! Quotes will be constructed randomly by assembling parts of sentences.

## Step 1: random quotes

Did you know ? There are online text generators. Type "quote generator" and you will find many sites that randomly generate quotes by assembling parts of sentences.

For a few french example, you have the [Pipotron](http://www.pipotron.free.fr/) and even the ... [Vandammotron](http://www.faux-texte.com/jean-claude-3.htm). In english, you have the [Inspiro Bot](https://inspirobot.me/) or the [QuoteGenerator.com](https://quotes-generator.com/)...

It's your turn to create one! You must respect the following instructions:

-   Citations are generated randomly one by one each time the JavaScript program is called

-   Each quotation is the **combination** of at least **3 pieces of sentences** (it's up to you to prepare these pieces of sentence)

-   Failing to be intelligible, the sentence must be consistent (no exclamation mark in the middle of a sentence)

The program can simply display the result in the JavaScript console.

## Step 2: configurable quotes

You now want to go further and offer the following options:

-   Choose the number of citations generated (from 1 to 5)

-   Choose between 2 types of quotation generators (you should therefore have 2 sets of sentences)

-   Once the quotes have been generated, offer to generate new quotes or stop the program there

Adapt the program so that it can offer these features. It's your turn !

## A few tips...

-   Before starting to code, **read carefully the statement again** to make sure you understand what is asked.

-   You can use _prompt_ and _alert_ calls to interact with the user 😉

-   Always check if the inputs from the user are correct.

-   Try to divide a big problem, into smaller and easier problems. Start small.

-   Try to have a working solution first, and then refactor it later.

-   Don't forget to comment your code!

-   In your README.md, please give a few examples about what could be improved in your code or functionality.

## Resources

You can use whatever resource you need for this project. You can use the internet. Feel free to check the code examples from [Educative](https://www.educative.io/courses/the-complete-javascript-course-build-a-real-world-app-from-scratch/), [Open Classroom](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/5664271-learn-programming-with-javascript) or [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

**This is not a group project**, so you're not allowed to exchange solutions with other students. You're not allowed to use Slack, other than to send me a link to your solution.

## Files to provide

-   Project JavaScript code
-   create a new README.md with your logic explaining how you solved the problem
-   Push your solution on Github before 16h30, and send me the link to your repository on slack.

## Skills to be validated

-   Design an algorithm to meet specifications
-   Implement JavaScript syntax in a program
-   Clean code (indentation, comments, clear variables and functions names)

## Good luck, and happy coding ✨
